This is a Project my team of 8 people created in a 26 hour interval for the Hack Fostercare LA Hackathon.

The pupose on this project is to solve the problem of case workers needing to schedule 3 seperate, 3 hour visits with a child's parents per week. Each of these visits need to be coordinated with a time and location along with transportation. And its especially difficult since siblings may get put in two seperate households, but they case worker needs to coordinate between all of their schedules.

We created a scheduling system that works with a ReactJS, with a Twilio and MongoDB backend that can automatically call everybody associated with the visit and get them to confirm on a time and a location.
